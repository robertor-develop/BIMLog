# OPEN_LOOP.md - BIMLog Open Product Loops

This is the operating register for unfinished BIMLog work. It exists so customer feedback, half-built features, cleanup tasks, quality issues, plugin tasks, and Replit/Codex handoffs do not disappear across compacted chats or focused tasks.

## Mandatory New Task Startup Rule

Every new BIMLog Codex, Claude, or Replit task must start with this repository check:

The BIMLog repo is not in the current mounted project folder. Use the real repo path:
C:\Dev\bimlog
If that path is unavailable, search C:\Dev for a folder containing artifacts, lib, living-brief, package.json, and pnpm-workspace.yaml. Do not proceed until the real repo is mounted.

After the repo is confirmed, read:
- OPEN_LOOP.md
- QUALITY.md
- STATUS.md
- PLATFORM.md
- PLUGIN.md when plugin work is involved
- The real current code being changed

## Operating Rules

- Add any user request here if it will not be finished in the current task.
- Move shipped work to Watching or Closed with commit, version, build, or publish notes.
- Do not mark work complete just because code was written.
- Complete means built, verified, understandable to the user, and not duplicating an existing flow.
- Keep every item specific, testable, and connected to Quality 4.0.
- Before building a new button, tab, export, or workflow, check whether one already exists.
- Duplicate controls are quality defects unless each has a clearly different named purpose.
- Customer requests must be translated into BIMLog architecture, not copied blindly.
- If a task is interrupted, write the exact remaining work here before switching topics.

## Active Now

### Submittals / Shop Drawing Control Field Test
Shipped baseline: commit 94c9c4b - Unify submittals shop drawing control.

Watch for:
- Ruben importing his real Shop Drawing Control Excel.
- Drawing Type filters, especially Sleeve / Sleeve V / Sleeve H.
- Trade filter behavior.
- Building Level source and imported row levels.
- Whether Register vs Submittal Packages vs Shop Drawing Control is clear to users.
- Whether exports match Ruben's operational Excel expectations.

Open design issue:
- BIMLog needs two connected worlds, not one confused Submittal bucket:
  - Shop Drawing Control: coordination deliverables, drawing packages, floors, trades, review status, RFI links.
  - Submittal Packages: equipment/material/product/documentation packages, approvals, warranties, O&M, final handover records.
- These worlds must cross-link where a shop drawing depends on an equipment/material submittal package.

## Ready Next

### Navisworks Plugin Two-Way Status Sync
Purpose: reduce web/plugin round-trips for status changes.

Known requests:
- Ruben wants to change Lens viewpoint status from the plugin.
- Ruben asked whether moving a viewpoint into a folder such as Resolved should update the platform.
- The plugin must not guess silently. If folder movement is supported, it must be explicit, logged, and reversible.

Guardrails:
- Read BIMLogLensPanel.cs and BIMLogApiClient.cs in full before editing.
- Understand all Lens buttons first: Save Viewpoint(s), Sync with BIMLog, Pull from Platform, Create RFI from Viewpoint, Load Selected Viewpoint, Done Managing Viewpoints, Reconcile/Cleanup.
- Protect non-BIMLog folders such as LEVELS.
- Protect against wrong-project sync. The plugin should clearly show the selected BIMLog project and warn before syncing if the Navisworks model/project context appears mismatched.
- Old dated BIMLog folders must be recognized for migration, but the final operational tree should be simple.

### BIMLog Feedback Widget
Purpose: replace Replit's feedback widget with BIMLog's own feedback/report-bug widget.

Requirements:
- No Replit branding.
- Available across the authenticated app.
- Capture page URL, project id when present, user id/email, category, severity, message, optional screenshot/file.
- Super admin can review submitted feedback.
- Should feed the Open Loop process instead of becoming lost chat context.

### Lens Excel Custom Report
Purpose: satisfy Ruben's request for a customized Lens Excel export with a report-style summary.

Required behavior:
- Keep the existing raw export.
- Add a configurable report export with a summary/pivot-style worksheet.
- Include filters and layout similar to Ruben's manual Excel customization.
- Export should be useful to send directly to clients without manual cleanup.

### Platform-Wide Duplicate Control Cleanup
Purpose: remove repeated buttons and confusing duplicate controls.

Known issue:
- Pages often show multiple Export PDF / Export Excel buttons that appear identical.

Rule:
- If two buttons do the same thing, keep one.
- If two buttons export different scopes, name them by scope and add hover help.
- This is a Quality 4.0 defect category, not cosmetic polish.

### AI Usage / Cost Controls
Purpose: make AI useful without surprising BIMLog or customers with hidden cost.

Current policy direction:
- Roberto/internal accounts can use the platform-managed Anthropic/Replit model path.
- External users should eventually use included quotas, managed paid tiers, or their own AI keys depending on product tier.
- Low-cost AI assist (description/email drafting) should be separate from high-cost file reading.
- Heavy AI file reading must show a clear warning before use.
- AI usage must be visible to the user and to super admin by user, project, feature, billing mode, and time period.

## Watching

### Schedule / Coordination Planner
Shipped commit: 2f9093b - Build coordination planner schedule.

What shipped:
- Calendar, Board, and List planner behavior.
- Editable buckets/sprints, default buckets, item moving, bucket rollover, and rollover history.
- RFIs and Submittals remain source-owned while Schedule stores planner placement separately.
- Structured 3D Model schedule fields: level, trade, company, assigned user, notes, due date, and status.
- Backend schema/startup migrations for planner buckets, item placements, rollover history, and milestone planner fields.

Watch after publish:
- Ruben's sprint/kanban workflow with incomplete tasks rolled forward.
- Whether 3D Model tasks are clear enough for trade/company/user responsibility.
- Whether delay attribution can identify repeated bottlenecks by company, trade, and user.
### Submittals Unification
Shipped commit: 94c9c4b - Unify submittals shop drawing control.

What shipped:
- One visible sidebar item: Submittals.
- Internal tabs: Submittal Packages, Register, Shop Drawing Control.
- Shop Drawing Control uses live existing submittals.
- Filters: Building Level, Trade, Drawing Type, Date, Review Status.
- Sleeve filtering includes Sleeve, Sleeve V, and Sleeve H.
- Building Level options combine Convention Builder /levels data with real submittal rows.
- Export labels/files use Shop-Drawing-Control scope.
- Backend Shop Drawing Control PDF/Excel exports respect the same filters.
- BIMLog's own Shop Drawing Control Excel export can be re-imported deterministically.

Watch after publish:
- Ruben's real import file.
- Whether users understand Register vs Submittal Packages vs Shop Drawing Control.
- Whether the Excel export is client-ready.

### Living Brief QUALITY.md
QUALITY.md is now a first-class Living Brief tab and should guide every feature.

Active enforcement needed:
- Run mojibake scan before production builds.
- Keep UI spreadsheet-simple.
- Every feature must answer record, location, owner, responsibility, change, reason, date, state, proof, and next decision.

## Deferred

### Telegram / WhatsApp Briefings
Idea: connect project briefings, schedule alerts, and delay/risk summaries to Telegram or another messaging channel.

Do not build until:
- Schedule data model is stable.
- Notification preferences are designed.
- Customer permission/opt-in rules are clear.

### Heavy AI File Reading
Do not make automatic.

Future behavior:
- User explicitly clicks AI file read.
- BIMLog warns that this may use AI credits.
- The extracted fields must show confidence and require user review.

## Closed / Shipped

### GitHub Merge Reconciliation
Resolved and pushed after manual Shell merge.
Remote master includes the Replit work plus Codex's Replit branding removal commit.

### Replit Branding Removal
Production no longer depends on old bim-log-ignite.replit.app references in searched source paths. Continue to prefer bimlog.app in user-facing URLs and OAuth callback docs.
